# BIST 100 and USD/TRY Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between the BIST 100 index and the USD/TRY exchange rate, and visualizes the analysis through various graphs. The analysis includes the monthly values of BIST 100 in USD, its annual percentage change, monthly highest and lowest values, moving average, and the annual average of the three largest fluctuations.

## Graph Descriptions

- **BIST 100's Monthly Values in USD and 12-Month Moving Average:** This graph shows the monthly closing values of the BIST 100 index in USD (blue line) and its 12-month moving average (red line). The moving average smooths out short-term price fluctuations, revealing the overall trend of the index more clearly.

- **BIST 100's Annual Percentage Change in USD:** The red line represents the annual percentage change in the value of BIST 100 at the end of each year compared to the end of the previous year. The vertical axis shows the annual return percentage of BIST 100 in USD.

- **BIST 100's Monthly Highest and Lowest Values:** The red line shows the highest value for each month, while the green line shows the lowest value. The yellow dots mark the largest fluctuations, i.e., the difference between the highest and lowest values within the month, and these differences are indicated by labels on the graph in percentage terms.

- **Annual Average of the Top Three BIST 100 USD Fluctuations:** Each bar represents the average percentage change of the three largest volatility events in the dollar-denominated value of the BIST 100 index for the respective year.
